## 🎮 Usage

### Voice Commands
- Click the microphone button to start voice recognition
- Speak clearly and wait for the assistant's response
- The assistant will respond both visually and audibly

### Text Input
- Type messages in the text input field
- Press Enter or click the send button
- Use Ctrl+K to quickly focus the input field

### Settings
- **Voice Speed**: Adjust speech synthesis speed (0.5x - 2.0x)
- **Voice Pitch**: Modify voice pitch (0.5x - 2.0x)
- **Auto-scroll**: Enable/disable automatic conversation scrolling
- **Theme**: Toggle between light and dark themes

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+K`: Focus text input
- `Ctrl+M`: Toggle voice recognition
- `Ctrl+D`: Toggle theme
- `Enter`: Send message (when input is focused)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Integration
The web app connects to your existing voice assistant backend through the Flask API. You can customize the response logic in `web_server.py`:

```python
def process_message(message, user_id):
    # Add your custom logic here
    # Integrate with your existing tools and functions
    pass
```

### Voice Settings
Adjust voice synthesis settings in the browser:
- **Speed**: Controls how fast the assistant speaks
- **Pitch**: Modifies the voice pitch
- **Voice Selection**: Automatically selects the best available voice

### Theme Customization
The app supports light and dark themes with CSS custom properties. You can customize colors in `static/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #ffffff;
    --text-primary: #1e293b;
    --accent-primary: #3b82f6;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### PWA Support
The app includes service worker registration for Progressive Web App capabilities:
- Offline functionality
- Installable on mobile devices
- App-like experience

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for:
- Speech recognition failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Browser compatibility problems
- API response errors

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of voice synthesis
- Efficient DOM updates
- Optimized animations
- Memory management for long conversations

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: Voice recognition requires secure context
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly escaped
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling without exposing sensitive data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice Recognition Issues
1. **Check microphone permissions**: Ensure the browser has microphone access
2. **Use HTTPS**: Voice recognition requires a secure connection
3. **Browser compatibility**: Test with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
4. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes helps with permission issues

### Network Issues
1. **Check server status**: Ensure `web_server.py` is running
2. **Verify port**: Default port is 5000
3. **Firewall settings**: Ensure port 5000 is accessible
4. **CORS issues**: Check browser console for CORS errors

### Performance Issues
1. **Close other tabs**: Voice recognition can be resource-intensive
2. **Update browser**: Use the latest browser version
3. **Check system resources**: Ensure adequate RAM and CPU
4. **Disable extensions**: Some browser extensions can interfere
